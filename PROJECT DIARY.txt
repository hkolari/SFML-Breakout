12:30:
Finally starting with the project after a long time of other busy assignments.
Downloaded Kim's test project and started working on it, since I was a bit uncertain of how to implement SFML.
It seems to work fine. Will begin now with creating a basic menu. Will have to create a menu class.

13:30:
Found an interesting tutorial of making a menu, so I checked it out and then proceded to create my own menu.
Got inspiration to change colour of currently selected menu choice box or whatever you call it from the video.

14:00:
Slight problems with with the selection. But it seems to work now.

14:30:
Got the menu controls working and threw them into menu.cpp and menu.h by the name of "handleMenuControls".

16:15:
Finally menu is done.

18:40:
Unable to get a moving playerpad to work. Frustrating.

19:40: Managed to get a moving PlayerPad to work a background.
Going to need to add a ball and barrier next time when I do programming. Ending the projekt for today. Or actually... Till now.
