12:30:
Finally starting with the project after a long time of other busy assignments.
Downloaded Kim's test project and started working on it, since I was a bit uncertain of how to implement SFML.
It seems to work fine. Will begin now with creating a basic menu. Will have to create a menu class.

13:30:
Found an interesting tutorial of making a menu, so I checked it out and then proceded to create my own menu.
Got inspiration to change colour of currently selected menu choice box or whatever you call it from the video.

14:00:
Slight problems with with the selection. But it seems to work now.

14:30:
Got the menu controls working and threw them into menu.cpp and menu.h by the name of "handleMenuControls".

16:15:
Finally menu is done.

18:40:
Unable to get a moving playerpad to work. Frustrating.

19:40: Managed to get a moving PlayerPad to work a background.
Going to need to add a ball and barrier next time when I do programming. Ending the projekt for today. Or actually... Till now.

Began working on the project on 13:00 or so. I have now made my ball and it moves and positioned my current objects to their correct position.
I will now experiment in putting an Entity that is connected by Ball and PlayerPad to share collission.

19:45:
Forgot to write diary. But What I have managed to do is make a simple collission between the ball and the playerpad.
I have found a problem with collision if it collides with the side of my playerpad, it will still go up and not to sides.
Will look if I can fix it somehow. Damn it, if only I had gone through Linjär Algebra already.

20:50:
No idea how to implement multiple bricks so I won't need to create more classes.
Will continue tomorrow though. I have not eaten anything. Done for now.
